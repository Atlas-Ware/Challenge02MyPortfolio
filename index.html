      <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello and God bless.</p>
            <br>
          <p>I am 34 years old and living in Miami, FL. 
                  I was raised by Cuban immigrants and married a Cuban American. 
                  I am a father of 3 beautiful children: 2 sons and 1 girl. 
                  I have been married for 10 years and have been with my wife for 18 years.</p> 
            <br>
          <p>I am currently studying computer coding at UCF. 
                My previous schooling was at Miami Dade College (MDC) School of Film, Television & Digital Productions. 
                I studied many fields while at MDC within the Film school: Productions, Editing, Screenwriting & Special Effects. 
                I became very fluent and exceptional in Video & Sound Editing and was hired by Advanced Media Network to do just that. 
                I edited their weekly web shows, client videos & showcase videos, such as IFA.</p> 
            <br>
          <p>After a couple of years of that I had my first child and decided to step down and be a stay-at-home father. 
                  Being a father has been my favorite career choice. I love taking care of them and playing with them.</p> 
            <br>
          <p>Now that my kids are in school, I am ready for my next adventure as a professional. 
                  I am looking forward to learning computer coding at UCF and expanding my skills as a citizen of God's world.</p> 
            <br>
          <p>Amen.</p>
